# ZSH-Suffix-Aliases

> Suffix aliases so that you can directly open any kind of file in zsh.

## Install

Just use a ZSH plugin manager of your choice

**Antigen**

    $ antigen bundle add srijanshetty/zsh-suffix-alias

## Usage

- Enter the name of a file in the shell prompt and viola, it will open up in the designated application.

- I couple this with the magnificent [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) which provides a fuzzy file
  picker for the shell.
